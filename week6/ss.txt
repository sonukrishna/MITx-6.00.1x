Encryption is the process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge. For centuries, people have devised schemes to encrypt messages - some better than others - but the advent of the computer and the Internet revolutionized the field. These days, it's hard not to encounter some sort of encryption, whether you are buying something online or logging into a shared computer system. Encryption lets you share information with other trusted people, without fear of disclosure.

A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The original information is called plaintext. After it is encrypted, it is called ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but it is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish to those for whom it is not intended.

A cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key. The key is incorporated into the encryption process; the same plaintext encrypted with two different keys should have two different ciphertexts. Without the key, it should be difficult to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.

This assignment will deal with a well-known (though not very secure) encryption method called the Caesar cipher. In this problem set you will need to devise your own algorithms and will practice using recursion to solve a non-trivial problem.
